CSS Box Model defines how elements are displayed on a webpage and how they are sized
border = a line around the element - still inside the element
padding = invisibile space around the content inside the element - sits between the content and the border
margin  =  creates space around/outside the element and not inside it - we use margin to create space between elements
final element width calculation = left border + left padding + width + right padding + right border
final element height calculation = top border + top padding + height + bottom padding + bottom border
this is the default behavior but we can change this by using CSS properties
inline-block = does not take the tnite space - takes as much space as needed - it is best to put it inside a container such as a div
and make an inline block so we clould palce elements besides/near eachother without taking thw whole space
display block - takes up the whole space line which forces a line before and after it depends on the html structure in the code
